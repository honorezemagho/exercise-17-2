        type coercion javascript automatically convert it to a string -->
        Round the number 4.87 to the nearest integer.
        <!-- We have to Math.round(4.87) who is equal to 5 -->
        Divide the number 6 by the string "2" and explain the result.
        <!-- The following expression return 'number' because 3 is a number -->
        What does the following expression return? Explain the result. 3 * "bob";
